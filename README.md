# 2005/2006 Media Server for Slippers
Before we start, please go clone the slippers repo if you want to make a CPPS.
You did that? Ok, let's get started.
All you need to do is use the git clone command
```git
git clone https://github.com/spacewd69/2005
```
Next, drag the contents of the newly created 2005 folder to your web server (htdocs if using xampp)
Then you need to drag the login.php file from slippers/www to the php folder in the media server
Lastly, edit the index.html file however you want, and thats all!
